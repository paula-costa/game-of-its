House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned went on to a completely pwn Circe and the Lannisters and take all their
monies.The world was a better place because of it.
bla bla bla
Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
 being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!
